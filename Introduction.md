# The Battle of Neighborhoods Introduction/Business Problems

## About the Project

I think people who are deciding to live in a specific area of Canada would like  to have access to information like housing prices and school ratings. This projects aim to conduct a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include house price and school ratings,  weather conditions, crime rates and recreational facilities, which would help people to know more about  the places before making the movement.

## How to compare

In this project, the rank of neighborhoods is given by

1. Housing prices
2. School ratings

More specifically, the rank will be higher with higher housing prices and school ratings.

After we make the comparison, we can confidently recommend the best neighborhood for our clients or friends.
